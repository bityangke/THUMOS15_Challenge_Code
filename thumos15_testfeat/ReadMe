Description:
This directory contains our action detection codes for pyramid score feature generation. The algorithm is described in our notebook paper:
http://storage.googleapis.com/www.thumos.info/thumos15_notebooks/TH15_ADSC.pdf

The codes apply to the validation and test dataset, where the pyramid score features are used.

Pre-requisites:
1. VL_FEAT Toolbox. http://www.vlfeat.org/
2. Improved Dense Trajectories (IDT). https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/improved_trajectories

The fisher.c in (1) needs to be modified to return unnormalized additive Fisher Vectors. A modified version is provided. Save the mex file to vl_fisher_unorm.mexa64.

For the Fisher Encoding part, we rewrite the following toolbox in matlab (for fast processing):
https://github.com/chensun11/dtfv  -- Fisher Encoding of Improved Dense Trajectories

Data:
1. VAL_ANO.mat, TEST_ANO.mat -- contains annotation (name, frame number) of videos.
2. UCF_PCA.mat -- contains PCA projection of IDT features (factor 2).
3. UCF_GMM.mat -- contains Gaussian Mixture Models of IDT features from UCF-101.
4. SVM_GFXY.mat -- contains 101376 * 101 dimensional SVM weights trained from UCF-101 (not provided due to large size, but simple to train from liblinear package).

(2) and (3) are trained using https://github.com/chensun11/dtfv. For simplicity, we provide the results rather than the actural training codes.


Process:
1. Extract IDT features with default parameters. Each row should provide a 436-dimensional feature vector, which contains basic trajectory info, HOG, HOF, MBHX and MBHY features. Store the features in HDF-5 format for fast access (70~80 times speed up from text format).
2. Using PCA for feature dimension reduction.
3. Using unnormalized additive Fisher Encoding on these featues for every 5 consecutive frames. The cluster number is 256. We only use HOG, HOF, MBHX and MBHY features in concatination.
4. Generate Pyramid score features using (3) and SVM weights as indicated in the notebook paper.
